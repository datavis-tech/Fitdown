# weightliftingML
Markup language and parser for weightlifting logs.

The idea is to be able to derive structured data from workout notes taken on a smartphone.

 * Workout date. It requires a very specific format, e.g. "Workout September 16, 2020". It triggers on the term "Workout".
 * Loosely formatted exercises, like "Up to technique bar + 35lb each side". It triggers on "lb".
 
 Many thanks to Justin Curry for the sample notes and notation ideas!
